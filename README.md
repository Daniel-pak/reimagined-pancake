# reimagined-pancake
A React Native project that allows users to view 'albums' (arbitrary object) and purchase them through the users mobile browser (default). The user is directed to Amazon listings by which they can purchase an album and then be directed back to the application. 

Project uses a live feed using an API connection with the axios dependency. All components (cards, card sections, buttons, lists) are built to be reusable and are maintained through other projects.

In order to run, make sure you have your React-Native dependencies installed first. Clone the project to your local and: 
1. Run `composer install`
2. cd into `albums'
3. Run `react-native run-[operating system here. ex: run-ios]`
